# vtk_triangulate_points
Creates triangulated surfaces using either Delaunay or Grid algorithms

## Objective
This script provides a open source and simple way to create triangulated surfaces (and solids) from point data.  
Input point data is usualy generated by traditional topography methods (toe and crest points). Those are best triangulated using Delaunay.  
But also can be generated by LIDAR (Laser), Drones (optical or radar) and even satellites (multiple spectral channels including IR). Those generate very dense point clouds which require a method other than Delaunay to create usable surfaces. In this cases "grid" is the recomended method.  
The grid method uses a voxel approach where the space is divided in cells and a single elevation value is estimated for each. If multple points fall inside the cell, they will be aggregated into a single value. If no point is inside, the search region will be increased until it can find at least one point. This is different from traditional Machine Learning interpolation method, which try to include ALL points in EVERY cell, leading to inviable computation costs.

## Engines
 - Grid: for dense point clouds
 - Delaunay 2d:exact toe/crest data or small point clouds
 - Delaunay 3d: same as 2d, but create a solid instead of surface
 - Outline: Create a simple visual bounding box (useful to get first look over the data extension when dealing with EXTREMELY large point clouds)

## Usage
The script accepts multple formats common in the Mining and Topgraphy industry:
 - ASCII Csv
 - ESRI Shapefile
 - Autodesk DXF
 - Excel XLSX
 - Las Topography (*.las)
 - Raster Geotiff (*.tif, *.tiff)
